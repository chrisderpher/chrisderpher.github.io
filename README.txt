This is the github for my personal website. It's based on Dimension by HTML5 UP, and I encourage you to check out their work. And mine!

The site includes interactive educational games - check them out via the Projects dropdown on the main page:
- Fractions: Tape measure fraction practice
- Ouroboros: Multiplication speed drill

For detailed documentation, see README.md.

If you're here, it's because you know what you're doing - and I admire that. Let's talk. Chris@ChrisMurphy.org.
